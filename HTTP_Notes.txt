HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
    application level TCP/IP Protocol based on communication protocol used to deliver data
such as HTML files, image files, query results, etc. 
    Basic Features:
        > Connectionless - request are made from independent new connections and then disconnects afterwards, this is repeated.
        > Media independent - any type of data can be send as long as both client and server knows how to handle the data content.
        > Stateless - Neither client nor server can retain each other's information in between request and response.

HTTP/1.0 - uses new connection every request/response exchange
HTTP/1.1 - connection may be used one or more times
